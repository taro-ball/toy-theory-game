#️⃣ Use the grid at the bottom to present your answer.

🕹️ Select a tile by clicking on it, then choose another tile to swap with. Repeat until you have arranged the tiles to match your guess.\
If you are correct, you will receive a win message. If not, you can reset the arrangement and try again. \
To view the result of your guess, click "Apply Map" Clicking 'Apply Map' again will reveal the original question.`]
